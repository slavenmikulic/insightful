# InsightfulTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

# Reason for eslint
Reason for using eslint is to have a consistent code style and to avoid common errors. It also helps to find bugs and code smells.

It easily integrates with IDEs and Angular and can be used in the command line.

I can manipulate with order of methods and properties, can integrate accessibility rules for html.

It easy to integrate prettier with eslint to format code.
